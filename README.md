# Introduction

This VST Plugin addresses the need for the automation of SoundScapeRenderer (SSR) scenes from a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).

This fork is an attempt to adapt the codebase to updated JUCE framework and the VST3 SDK. This VST can run in Nuendo, Cubase, Reaper and other DAW's but it has only been tested on a small number of Win10 machines. It is a 'bare-bones' implementation which bypasses some deprecated JUCE functions and addresses some performance issues that were causing crashes and hangs when multiple instances of the plugin were running in a DAW. Some functionality has been removed compared to the original codebase, notably any references to JACK (although JACK still needs to be present for SSR to run!).

Since this is a experimental open source project, any contributions are very much welcome!

# Known Bugs
This VST3 plugin will cause its host DAW to hang if the SSR is shut down while the VST is 'Connected'.

This VST3's GUI window must remain open or minimised when connected to SSR, otherwise SSR suffers memory leaks


# TODO :: Update this doc for Windows  /#TODO

# Installation
Please read the installation guide.

You need to compile the boost lib's using the same compiler/linker as the VST itself. This fork is compiling and working using VS2017.

All references to jack have been commented out. Consequently, the ability to add new sources to SSR from the VST is disabled.

# Configuration
Environment Variables
Please set the environment variables as follows, since the following environment variables are not only needed for compilation but also at runtime:

The directory/location of the Steinberg VST3 SDK (needed at compile time):

# Steinberg VST3 Audio Plug-Ins SDK
export VST3_SDK=/path/to/VST3SDK
The directory/location of the SSRemote VST (needed at runtime):

# SSRemote VST
export SSREMOTE_VST=/path/to/ssremote_vst
The directory/location of the JUCE Framework located in the SSRemote VST (needed at compile time):

# SSRemote VST JUCE Framework (Not required if using VS2017 project created by Projucer)
export JUCE_LIB_CODE=$SSREMOTE_VST/JUCE

# XML Configuration File
The VST Plugin requires a config file to successfully establish a TCP/IP connection to the SSR. The user has to create a file called ssremote_config.xml with the following content and it must be placed in the "SSREMOTE_VST" path env variable as above:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<config>
  <network>
    <host>localhost</host>
    <port>4711</port>
    <timeout>1000</timeout>
  </network>
</config>

Markup	Description
network	the network configuration
host	the host on which the SSR is running
port	the port on which the SSR is listening for incoming TCP/IP requests
timeout	the time in milliseconds the VST Plugin waits for an answer by the SSR
The contents of the markups host, port and timeout are just examples which the user may edit regarding his systems and SSR configuration.

General Information
Running the VST Plugin
To remotly control the SSR scene from the Plugin the user has to do the following:

Start the JACK Audio Connection Kit
Start the SSR and load a scene
Start the DAW and load the SSRemote VST Plugin
Description of the GUI
The VST Plugins GUI is generally splitted in two sections. The General Controls section and the Source Controls section.

General Controls
Name	GUI Element	Description
Connect	Button	connects or disconnects the connection to the SSR
The 'New Source' button is disabled.

Source Controls
Name	GUI Element	Description
Source	Dropdown	select a source for manipulation
Name	Textfield	read and writeable textfield for the name of the source
|Model |Dropdown |select the type of model of the source| |Azimuth |Textfield |readable only textfield for displaying the sources orientation| |Mute |Button |mutes and unmutes the source| |Fix |Button |fix and unfix the source position| |Gain |Slider |adjust the gain of the source in dB| |Source Control Pad|2D Pad|displayes the sources position| |Zoom |Buttons |zooms in and out the Source Control Pad| |Scale Reference|- |displays a scale reference in meter for the Source Control Pad| |X Position |Slider |controller for the X position of the source| |Y Position |Slider |controller for the Y position of the source|

Automatable Parameters
The Host (DAW) is able to automate the following parameters:

Source to manipulate
X Position
Y Position

Logfiles ## Logging is currently disabled!! ##
The Plug-In logs will be written to the file log.txt, located in the root directory.
The logs will look as follows:

[YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS] [<LOGTYPE>] <Log text>
